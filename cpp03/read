## Overview of the Projects

The assignments in this module build your understanding of object-oriented programming through a series of exercises based on inheritance in C++. They start with a basic class and then gradually add features, different behaviors, and even multiple inheritance. The projects covered include:

1. **Exercise 00: ClapTrap**  
2. **Exercise 01: ScavTrap**  
3. **Exercise 02: FragTrap**  
4. **Exercise 03: DiamondTrap**

Each exercise extends the previous one, adding complexity and new concepts.

## Detailed Project Explanations

### Exercise 00: ClapTrap

- **Objective:**  
  Create a basic class named `ClapTrap`.

- **Key Attributes:**  
  - **Name:** Provided via a constructor parameter.  
  - **Hit Points:** Represents health (starts at 10).  
  - **Energy Points:** Represents the energy to perform actions (starts at 10).  
  - **Attack Damage:** Damage value (starts at 0).

- **Key Member Functions:**  
  - **attack(const std::string& target):**  
    Prints a message about attacking a target. It should also reduce the energy by 1.
  - **takeDamage(unsigned int amount):**  
    Reduces hit points based on the damage taken and prints a message.
  - **beRepaired(unsigned int amount):**  
    Increases hit points by the repair amount (using 1 energy point) and prints a message.

- **Additional Requirements:**  
  The constructor and destructor should output messages so you can trace object creation and destruction.

*Simple Explanation:*  
Think of `ClapTrap` as a simple robot with health, energy, and the ability to attack or heal itself. When it attacks or heals, it uses energy, and if it runs out of health or energy, it can’t perform these actions.

### Exercise 01: ScavTrap

- **Objective:**  
  Create a new class `ScavTrap` that inherits from `ClapTrap` but has different attributes and behaviors.

- **Differences from ClapTrap:**  
  - **Attribute Values:**  
    - Hit Points: 100  
    - Energy Points: 50  
    - Attack Damage: 20
  - **Overridden Functions:**  
    - The constructor, destructor, and the `attack()` function output different messages than those in `ClapTrap` to emphasize that it’s a different type of robot.
  - **Special Member Function:**  
    - **guardGate():**  
      A unique function that prints a message indicating that the `ScavTrap` is now in “Gate keeper” mode.

*Simple Explanation:*  
Imagine `ScavTrap` as a tougher, more robust version of `ClapTrap`. It has more health and energy and an extra ability to guard a gate. Even though it reuses the basic structure of `ClapTrap`, it shows its individuality through different messages and values.

### Exercise 02: FragTrap

- **Objective:**  
  Develop another derived class, `FragTrap`, from `ClapTrap`, again with its own twist.

- **Differences from ClapTrap:**  
  - **Attribute Values:**  
    - Hit Points: 100  
    - Energy Points: 100  
    - Attack Damage: 30
  - **Unique Feature:**  
    - **highFivesGuys():**  
      A function that, when called, outputs a positive high-five request message.

*Simple Explanation:*  
`FragTrap` is like a cheerier or more enthusiastic version of the basic robot. It is designed to be energetic with high energy and attack values. The high five function is its signature move, making it stand out.

---

### Exercise 03: DiamondTrap

- **Objective:**  
  Combine features from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap` using multiple inheritance to create `DiamondTrap`.

- **Challenges and Key Points:**  
  - **Multiple Inheritance:**  
    `DiamondTrap` inherits from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`. This can create challenges, such as which inherited attributes to use (known as the “diamond problem”).
  - **Attribute Management:**  
    - The class has its own private `name` attribute.  
    - The `ClapTrap` name is automatically set as the provided name with a suffix (typically `"_clap_name"`).
  - **Inherited Attributes:**  
    - **Hit Points:** Taken from `FragTrap`  
    - **Energy Points:** Taken from `ScavTrap`  
    - **Attack Damage:** Taken from `FragTrap`
  - **Unique Function:**  
    - **whoAmI():**  
      This function prints both the `DiamondTrap`’s own name and its associated `ClapTrap` name, showing the connection between the derived and base parts.

*Simple Explanation:*  
`DiamondTrap` is like a hybrid robot that has qualities of both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`. By combining these, it demonstrates multiple inheritance. The tricky part is keeping track of which “version” of the name or attributes you’re using, and `whoAmI()` helps by printing out both names.

## Common Evaluation Questions & Explanations

When preparing for evaluation, you might be asked a variety of questions. Here are some examples along with clear, deep explanations:

1. **What is Inheritance in C++?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a class (called the derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the base or parent class). This promotes code reuse and logical organization. For example, `ScavTrap` inherits from `ClapTrap`, meaning it uses the basic robot functionality and then extends or customizes it.

2. **How do Constructors and Destructors Work in Inheritance?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   When you create an object of a derived class, the base class constructor is called first, followed by the derived class constructor. During object destruction, the derived class’s destructor is executed before the base class’s destructor. This order ensures that the base class is properly initialized and later cleaned up, avoiding resource leaks or undefined behavior.

3. **What Is the Orthodox Canonical Form?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   The Orthodox Canonical Form is a set of guidelines for writing C++ classes. It requires that if a class manages resources (like dynamic memory), it should explicitly define:
   - A default constructor
   - A copy constructor
   - An assignment operator
   - A destructor  
   This ensures proper copying and cleanup, preventing memory leaks and undefined behavior.

4. **How Does Multiple Inheritance Work, and What Are Its Pitfalls?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. In `DiamondTrap`, you inherit from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`. A common pitfall is the diamond problem—where an attribute or function from a common base (like `ClapTrap`) is inherited more than once. This requires careful design, often using virtual inheritance, to resolve ambiguities.

5. **What Are Include Guards, and Why Are They Important?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Include guards are preprocessor directives used in header files to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file. They ensure that the compiler processes a header file only once per translation unit, which prevents errors like redefinition and reduces compilation time.

6. **How Do You Prevent Memory Leaks in C++?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Memory leaks happen when dynamically allocated memory (using `new`) is not released (using `delete`). To avoid leaks:
   - Always match `new` with `delete`.
   - Use smart pointers (in modern C++, though not allowed in these exercises) where possible.
   - Follow the Rule of Three/Five to properly manage resources when copying or assigning objects.

7. **What Are the Key Differences Between Composition and Inheritance?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Inheritance implies an “is-a” relationship (e.g., a `ScavTrap` is a `ClapTrap`), meaning the derived class extends the base class. Composition implies a “has-a” relationship where one class contains objects of another class. In these exercises, inheritance is used to extend functionality.

8. **How Do You Override Functions in Derived Classes?**  
   *Explanation:*  
   Overriding is when a derived class provides its own implementation for a function that is already defined in the base class. In these projects, the derived classes (like `ScavTrap`) override the `attack()` method to print different messages and possibly perform additional actions.

9. **Explain the Special Member Functions Unique to Derived Classes:**  
   - **guardGate() in ScavTrap:**  
     Puts the robot into a “gate keeper” mode, demonstrating additional behavior on top of the base class functions.
   - **highFivesGuys() in FragTrap:**  
     Requests a high five, showing a fun, unique behavior that distinguishes it from other classes.
   - **whoAmI() in DiamondTrap:**  
     Displays both its own name and the modified base name (`ClapTrap`’s name), illustrating how multiple inheritance can combine attributes from different parent classes.

10. **How Do You Compile C++ Code with Strict Flags and Why?**  
    *Explanation:*  
    The guidelines require you to compile with flags like `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror`. These flags:
    - **-Wall:** Enable all standard warnings.
    - **-Wextra:** Enable additional warnings not covered by `-Wall`.
    - **-Werror:** Treat all warnings as errors.  
    This practice forces you to write cleaner, error-free code and helps catch potential issues early.

## Final Thoughts

Each exercise builds on the previous one, not only adding new functionality but also teaching you essential C++ concepts like inheritance, proper resource management, and multiple inheritance challenges. When evaluated, examiners are likely to ask questions that cover both the technical details (like how constructors work or how to avoid memory leaks) and the conceptual understanding (such as the benefits of inheritance and design decisions behind special member functions).

This comprehensive approach ensures you have a strong foundation in both practical programming and theoretical concepts—key to mastering C++ and object-oriented programming.
