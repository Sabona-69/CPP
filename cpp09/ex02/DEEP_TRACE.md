## 🎯 BINARY INSERTION WITH LIMITED SEARCH (Level 1)

### Current State:
```
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
sortedPairs = [(2,4), (8,9)]
               index0  index1
insertionOrder = [1]
```

We need to insert: `sortedPairs[1].b = 8`

---

## 📐 STEP 1: Identify What We're Inserting

```cpp
idx = insertionOrder[0] = 1      // First (and only) element in order
bValue = sortedPairs[1].b = 8    // The value to insert
aValue = sortedPairs[1].a = 9    // Its paired 'a' value
```

### Variables:
```
bValue = 8
aValue = 9
```

---

## 📐 STEP 2: Find Position of Paired 'a' Value

We need to find where `aValue = 9` is in mainChain:

```cpp
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
             ↑  ↑  ↑
            pos0 1 2

Find: where is 9?
```

**Search through mainChain:**
```cpp
for j = 0; j < mainChain.size(); j++:
    if mainChain[j] == aValue:
        aPos = j
        break
```

- j=0: mainChain[0] = 2, is 2 == 9? NO
- j=1: mainChain[1] = 4, is 4 == 9? NO
- j=2: mainChain[2] = 9, is 9 == 9? YES! ✅

```cpp
aPos = 2  ✅
```

---

## 📐 STEP 3: Set Up Binary Search Range

### The Key Rule:
**We can only search from position 0 up to aPos (the paired 'a' position)**

Why? Because we know: `bValue ≤ aValue`
- We compared them during pairing
- bValue = 8, aValue = 9
- So 8 ≤ 9 ✅
- Therefore 8 cannot be AFTER position of 9

### Set up search boundaries:
```cpp
left = 0
right = min(aPos + 1, mainChain.size())
     = min(2 + 1, 3)
     = min(3, 3)
     = 3
```

### Variables at start of binary search:
```
left = 0
right = 3
bValue = 8 (looking for where to insert this)
```

### Search range visualization:
```
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
             ↑  ↑  ↑  
           pos0 1  2  (3 is after last element)

left = 0  ──────┐
                ↓
                [2, 4, 9]
                        ↑
                        └────── right = 3 (one past last element)

Search space: indices [0, 1, 2]
Values:       [2, 4, 9]
```

---

## 📐 STEP 4: Binary Search Loop

Binary search finds where to insert 8 so the array stays sorted.

### Loop Condition:
```cpp
while (left < right):
```

---

### **ITERATION 1:**

**Check condition:**
```cpp
left < right?
0 < 3?
YES ✅ Continue
```

**Calculate middle:**
```cpp
mid = left + (right - left) / 2
    = 0 + (3 - 0) / 2
    = 0 + 3/2
    = 0 + 1
    = 1  ✅
```

**Compare:**
```cpp
mainChain[mid] < bValue?
mainChain[1] < 8?
4 < 8?
YES ✅
```

**Action when mainChain[mid] < bValue:**
```cpp
// Our value (8) is BIGGER than mid value (4)
// So it must go in the RIGHT half
left = mid + 1
     = 1 + 1
     = 2  ✅
```

**State after iteration 1:**
```
left = 2
right = 3
mid was = 1

Visual:
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
                ↑  ↑
              left right=3
             (pos2)
```

---

### **ITERATION 2:**

**Check condition:**
```cpp
left < right?
2 < 3?
YES ✅ Continue
```

**Calculate middle:**
```cpp
mid = left + (right - left) / 2
    = 2 + (3 - 2) / 2
    = 2 + 1/2
    = 2 + 0      (integer division!)
    = 2  ✅
```

**Compare:**
```cpp
mainChain[mid] < bValue?
mainChain[2] < 8?
9 < 8?
NO ❌
```

**Action when mainChain[mid] >= bValue:**
```cpp
// Our value (8) is NOT bigger than mid value (9)
// So it must go in the LEFT half
right = mid
      = 2  ✅
```

**State after iteration 2:**
```
left = 2
right = 2
mid was = 2

Visual:
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
                   ↑
              left=right=2
```

---

### **CHECK LOOP CONDITION:**

```cpp
left < right?
2 < 2?
NO ❌ STOP
```

**Binary search is complete!**

---

## 📐 STEP 5: Insert the Element

We found the insertion position: `left = 2`

```cpp
mainChain.insert(position = left, value = bValue)
mainChain.insert(2, 8)
```

### Before insertion:
```
mainChain = [2, 4, 9]
            pos0 1  2
```

### Insert at position 2:
```
Shift elements from position 2 onwards to the right:
[2, 4, _, 9]
       ↑
    Insert 8 here
```

### After insertion:
```
mainChain = [2, 4, 8, 9]  ✅
            pos0 1  2  3
```

---

## 📊 FINAL STATE (Level 1):

```
Input was:       [9, 8, 4, 2]
Sorted result:   [2, 4, 8, 9]  ✅
```

**This level is complete!** We return [2, 4, 8, 9] to the level above.

---

## 🔙 RETURN TO MAIN LEVEL (Level 0)

Now we go back to the main level where we were sorting:
`[6, 9, 5, 8, 3, 4, 1, 2, 7]`

We called recursion to sort the 'a' values [9, 8, 4, 2]
And we just got back: [2, 4, 8, 9] ✅

---

## 📍 BACK AT MAIN LEVEL (Level 0)

### Current Context:
```cpp
Original input:   [6, 9, 5, 8, 3, 4, 1, 2, 7]
Leftover saved:   7
Working array:    [6, 9, 5, 8, 3, 4, 1, 2]
Pairs created:    [(6,9), (5,8), (3,4), (1,2)]
Extracted 'a':    [9, 8, 4, 2]
sorted_a (from recursion): [2, 4, 8, 9]  ✅ JUST RETURNED!
```

### What's Next:
Now we do the SAME process at the main level:
1. Reorder pairs by sorted_a
2. Build main chain
3. Calculate Jacobsthal for 3 remaining b values
4. Insert them one by one

## ❓ UNDERSTANDING CHECK:

Q1: What did the binary search do?
    → Found where to insert 8 into [2, 4, 9]
    → Result: [2, 4, 8, 9]

Q2: Why was right = 3 (not 2)?
    → In binary search, right is EXCLUSIVE
    → It points one past the last element we can search
    → This is standard practice

Q3: Why was the search limited to position 2?
    → Because 8 is paired with 9
    → And 9 is at position 2
    → We know 8 ≤ 9, so 8 can't be after position 2

Q4: How many comparisons did we make?
    → 2 comparisons total:
      - Compare 8 with 4 (at mid=1)
      - Compare 8 with 9 (at mid=2)
