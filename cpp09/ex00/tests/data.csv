1. Bitcoin Exchange Calculator (ex00)
   - Critical Bug: The calculatedAndPrintValue function attempts to access an invalid iterator when the exact date is not found in the database
   - Logic Error: The algorithm for finding closest dates was inverted
   - Minor Bug: Inconsistent error value checking (-1 vs -42)

  2. RPN Calculator (ex01)
   - Critical Bug: The result of operations is never pushed back to the stack due to incorrect placement of code after the switch statement
   - Functional Issue: The calculator only processes individual characters, not multi-digit numbers

  Testing Results
   - The Bitcoin Exchange calculator works for basic cases but has issues with edge cases and closest-date lookups
   - The RPN calculator fails for all test cases due to the critical bug
